        Mm-mm and I said fuck it!
        Guess all that shit we been through
        It jus' don't add up to nothin'
        Remember times I bought that bank out just so I can get you something
        Invested all this time and you just left with no discussion
        Same bitch that stabbed my back said, "I won't fold on you for nothing"
        It's like we made some plans and I showed up but you ain't come
        What's the point of building bridges if they burn she up and run?
        Guess I'm gon' count these funds again, money my only fun</p>

        Can't wait till I blow up just like a TNT (TNT)
        Just tell me how you feel and what you see in me (see in me)
        I need my crib so big this bitch a BNB (a BNB)
        Back then when I was broke these hoes ain't think of Eem (think of Eem)
        You tryna to place the blame on me that's not my fault (not my fault)
        Don't judge me about my past can't take this pain at all (pain at all)
        You said you'll stick around ain't answer when I called (when I called)

        Best stay the fuck from round me
        For those who want to down me
        Don't get too close to people
        I had to set that boundary
        I had to cut my bitch
        She had my mental drowning
        I'm riding with my blick
        If you try me I might down 'em</p>
